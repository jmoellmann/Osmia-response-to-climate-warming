# Osmia-response-to-climate-warming

Insect pollination is critical for both wildflower stability and agricultural yields, with solitary bees being a group of pollinators of key importance. However, declines in solitary bee populations, exacerbated by climate change, pose significant threats to the provision of this service. Exposure to elevated temperatures associated with climatic change during periods of dormancy, where solitary bees are vulnerable to changes in environmental conditions, is suggested to have consequences on their condition and survival. However, we lack studies investigating this relationship under ecologically relevant and future predicted elevated temperature exposure. To address this gap in our understanding, we simulated three field-realistic temperature profiles including a baseline profile representing present-day overwintering conditions and two profiles representing future predictions informed by two major climate warming scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) and exposed individuals of geographically distinct sources of both sexes of Osmia bicornis and Osmia cornuta to all three conditions to determine how emergence timing, weight loss and survival are affected. We found that both exposure to temperatures under intermediate and the worst-case climate warming scenarios led to drastically earlier emergence  by approximately three and six weeks, respectively, which substantially exceeds predictions for earlier flowering onset in pollinated host plants, adding to concerns about phenological mismatches between pollinators and plants. While we found no effects on survival rates during overwintering, we observed increased weight loss in response to elevated temperatures and evidence of species-specific and sex-specific differences therein and inferred that weight loss is unlikely to play a major role as trigger of emergence timing in mason bees. Our study highlights the importance for temperature exposure studies using field-relevant temperatures as well as increased phenotypic diversity in experimental set-ups.
